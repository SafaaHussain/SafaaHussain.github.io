<h1>Preparing for Earthquakes</h1>

<img src="https://www.fractracker.org/a5ej20sjfwe/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Earthquake-Feature-2.jpg" alt="earthquake" width="600" height="250">

<p>
Living in California, it is essential to prepare for future earthquakes. "An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities.(Wikipedia)". You can prepare by first making a plan for your household. Identify places to take cover, and teach people signals for help. Practice "drop, cover, and hold on". Identify out-of-building areas, turn off home utilities, write down emergency contacts. Also, make an emergency earthquake kit containing the following: 

1. 3 days worth of non-perishable, salted, or canned food 

2. Flashlights and a radio, with extra batteries 

3. A first aid kit 

4. A basic tool kit 

5. Water (one gallon per person for at least 3 days)

With these tips, you can be better prepared for when an earthquake strikes.

<p>******************************</p>      
<p>*Remember these tips to prevent fires in your own home:*</p>

<p>1. Turn off portable space heaters when you aren't using them. Heating equipment is the source of an additional 24% of home fire fatalities.</p>

<p>2. Turn off the stove if you have to leave the room. Cooking equipment is a leading source of home fire injuries!</p>

<p>3. Keep matches and lighters out of reach of children, especially under the age of 5.</p>


<p>******************************</p>
<p>Remember these tips to stay safe during a fire:</p>

<p>1. Install a smoke alarm. One working smoke alarm in each bedroom is best, or at least one per floor.</p>

<p>2. Regularly test that your fire alarm is still working.</p>

<p>2. Plan and practice a home fire drill. Make sure everyone in your home knows how to follow the plan to keep you all safe!</p>

<p>******************************</p>
<p>Call a family meeting to ensure that you have a plan to:</p>

<p>*Get out right away!</p>
<p>*Go directly to your meeting place, where firefighters can see you clearly.</p>
<p>*Don't go back inside for anything! This is too risky!</p>
<p>*Call 9-1-1 immediately! Provide your precise address.</p>

<h1>FLOODS<h1>
<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded_edit2.jpg" width = "400" height = "450">
<p>
Flooding happens when an overflow of water occurs on land that is normally dry. Flooding can happen with only a few inches of water or massive amounts of snowfall. Flooding can happen for a variety of different reasons. It can happen for both long and short periods of time. Some floods occur without any warning, and are aptly named flash floods.


What to do:
- Do not drive through of walk though floods.

  --> 6 inches of moving water can knock you down!
- Always move to higher ground, do not stay in your car if flooding should occur.
- Prepare your home for flood 

  --> Disconnect electrical appliances

  --> Turn off gas and electricity if instructed.

  --> Move valuable objects to a higher ground.
- Flood warning

  --> Go to higher ground.

  --> Do not walk or drive through flood waters.

- After the flood

  --> Return home when the authorities say it is safe.

  --> Avoid standing water and flooded areas because you may get an electrical shock.

alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Hurricane_Fran_sept_1996.jpg" width="450" height="400">

<p>Hurricanes are one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters. There are roughly 85 hurricanes a year, but not all of them cause as much damage as Hurricane Katrina which killed 1,836 people and cost $100 BILLION in property damage. In order to be prepared for the disaster, for you never know when it might strike, you should follow the advice below.

1. Create a hurricane kit. 
It should contain:
    
     *water (one gallon per person, a week's supply)
     
     *non-perishable foods that don't need to be cooked such as:
      canned fruits, soups, ready-to-eat canned meats, peanut butter, bread, cereal, oatmeal, crackers, pet food (IF YOU 
      HAVE A PET: DON'T EAT THIS!!!), lots of Halloween candy, etc.

     *cooler for storing food in 

     *cell phone or portable, windup radio

     *important documents (wills, insurance records, medical records)

     *extra clothing (preferably waterproof)

     *cash, LOTS of it! (at least $200)

     *personal hygiene products (toilet paper, shampoo, toothpaste, bath sponge, soap, etc.)

     *blankets and sleeping bags

     *first aid kit
	    (tweezers, pocket/utility knife, bandages, gauze, disinfectant wipes, etc.)
       	
     *cooking utensils 

     *matches or firelighter (make sure these are waterproof or in a watertight bag!)

     *disposable utensils

     *flashlight with extra batteries

     *rolls of heavy plastic or heavy duty plastic bags
     
     *life vests, whistles, and flares (Be careful not to light your hair on fire! or your clothes...)

     *hand-operated can opener

     *shovels 

     *heavy rope

     *prescription medicine (inhalers, allergy medicine, Tylenol, etc.) 

     *insect repellant (For those nasty misquotes!) 

     *board games, funny cat pictures, or other activities to keep yourself from dying from boredom (if you bring 
      Monopoly, make sure to bring extra money so you can help yourself... wink wink)

2. Evacuate as soon as the local officials tell you! Don't wait until the last minute!

3. Protect your home! 
	Even if you don't live close to the coast, make sure to keep your house protected by trimming any low hanging branches, fixing any broken doors or windows, and making sure the foundation is stable.

<h1> What causes natural disasters? </h1>

<p>Natural disasters are caused by 3 main things:

1. The movement of Earth's plates
          - These are sudden and unexpected
          - Ex.) Volcanoes, tsunamis, earthquakes

2. Weather related disasters
          - There is some advanced warning, but they cannot be stopped
          - Ex.) Hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme heat/cold

3. Consequences of extreme weather events
          - They are the result of extreme, unforeseen disasters
          - Ex.) Floods, mudslides, landslides
